# Human-Complex-Reflective-Portfolio
# Week 1
What have I learnt this week 

This week was the first week of classes for this subject, within the 3 hours there was alot of content to learn and understand. Some of the key takeaways from this lesson was the general introduction to complex systems (eg. what they are, how they work, key characteristics). We also learnt about our classmates and teachers through a mural activity that we did, this allowed me to know my peers better; this activity also helped me find suitable group memebers that share similar interests to me. I also learnt that complicated and complex systems are different, although they have some similarities they also have differences. Compex systems refer to a system with many components which interact with eachother, these systems are able to observe, learn and adapt to create change. Whereas complicated systems need an external force in order to introduce change in the system. Overall, there were many topics and themes discussed in this week that were very new to me, so it took a while for me to process the information into a way i was able to understand it.

What do I now know that I did not before

The whole idea of complex systems is something i know about now but not before and very new to me aswell. This lesson gave me an insight into what complex systems are and how they govern and impact us as human beings. This lesson also gave me insight into on how complex systems exist in our everyday lives in forms such as human economies, infastructures, and even in ourseleves (human brain and nervous system). This was a very interesting inisght that i gained in this lesson which inspired me to further research into other types of complex systems and their impact on us as humans. The human brain is a complex system; with the neurons acting as the components that interact with eachother to form circuits and share information aswell as observe and create change. I also found out that complex systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated. 

What theory proved to be useful?

All of the theory discussed in the lesson proved to be useful, this is because we need to know the fundamentals of complex systems in order to successfully complete our final assignment. Also, an understanding of complex systems will also be useful in everyday life as we grow older as adults and gain exposure to the outside world. 

What are strengths and weaknesses I observed 

One of the weakness i observed is that i was unable to keep focused for the 2+ hours the lesson went for, although we had breaks in the middle it was still a bit diffuclt as it was our first lesson and i wasn't used to being in a class for more than 2 hours. Another weakness is that since alot of information was not on the slides but we had to listen to, it was difficult for me to take notes as we went on; however i hope i will improve with note-taking as the semester goes on. 

# Week 2

What have I learnt this week

The things i have learnt this week are that complex systems are indeed complex (hence the name). Complex systems provide models which can be helpful to experiment and test our ideas on how the world works. We also got more information about our assignment and formed groups. There are many reasons as to why we model and it highlights why modelling is important. These include 
	- Communication 
	- Prediction about the future 
	- Exploration of the world around us 
  
What insights have I gained 

The insights gained this lessons is that all models are wrong, but many are useful; us as humans just have to pick that right number of modest models that can help us better understand problems in complex systems around the world. Complex adaptive systems are the future of our lives and understanding this before we progress into our career will be highly beneficial. Another insight gained is that one model has many uses and this can help improve on the wisdom of the crowd, hence models can be taken out of their initial purpose and shifted to another use and they would produce similar or better results highligting the versatility of models. 

What are strengths and weaknesses i observed

The strengths i observed this week was that it was really easy for me to communicate with my peers and form a group, however since it is just week 2 i couldn't add much on group work but as the semester progresses i will add updates about group work. Other than that there were no weaknesses that i observed this week. 

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did i/my team handle them? 

The challenges i encountered this module was not fully understanding the content being taught, it took me a while to understand the concepts aswell as create a connection on how this content links with the whole course being taught. 

What would I do better next time with what anticipated results? 

I would try do my own research before and after class so i understand the concepts and content. I should also ask more questions in class if i am unsure of something that is being taught. 

# Week 3: Didn't Attend Class 

# Week 4 

What have I learnt this week 

There are different types of models that increase the level of integration, flexibility and realism within the world. These include system dynamic models, network models and agent based models. System dynamic models analyse different systems and provide feedback on the relationships between the systems and their surroundings. Agent based models are computational  models that stimulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with the goals of assessing their effects on the system as a whole. Whereas network models, is a database model that is designed as a flexible approach to represent objects and their relationships. 

What do I now know that I did not before 

I have learnt that all these models can be applied to everyday life, making it easier for us as humans to make predictions. I also learnt about feedback loops and the inclusion of the diagrams helped me understand this foreign concept much better. 

What insights have i gained? 

The insights gained this lesson was that not all the models mentioned above can be used for every situation. Agent based models are more suitable for real life situations whereas the other two ( system dynamic and network models) are less effective in stimulating solutions for real world problems. Therefore since my groups' issue is about education i have made note to use agent based models to complete the assignment. 

What are strengths and weaknesses I observed? 

One of the weakness i had this week was not being able to catch up and understand the information as quickly as i would like to. It took me a while to grasp the concepts of all these models are how they are different fromm eachother aswell as which models are suitable for paticular situations. However, a strength i observed was that our group was able to communicate well and form a group chat quickly to talk about the assignment due. 

What would i do better next time with what anticipated results? 

Things i would do better for next lesson is that i would pay more attention in class. Although class being nearly 3 hours long and hard to concentrate in i would like to take small breaks along the way so that i am attentative and listening. 


# Week 5

What have I learnt this week 

This week we learnt about probability within complex systems, such as aggregation, regularity and extremities. Probability distributions is a function which describes the likelihood of obtaining a possible value a random variable can take. Regularity describes the normal distributions in a bell shaped curve which usually are depicted with high accuracy. This shows that scores are evenly distributed throughout the scale with the majority distributed in the centre and outliers. 

What do i now know that I did not before 

Probability models make predictions to be made about random variables and their behaviour with surrounding systems. However these models are not fully accurate, but can be taken as a guide. In probability the chance of an event likely to occur will always add up to 1, with 0 being on the impossible side and 1 being certain. 

What insights have I gained 

The insights i have gained this lesson was watching the TED talk given by Geoff West, this was something different compared to normal class routine so i found this very interesting. The inisghts gained from the video include how power laws help/contribute to the communications within cities which in turn allow them to thrive. Without these cities will indefinately collapse. 

What are strengths and weaknesses I observed

We had a group meeting to discuss our assignment aswell as pick a topic for our assignment. We decided to pick our theme as smart cities and focus on various other broad topics. Some of the strengths i noticed was that our group worked together and split up our roles efficiently between our team members. We also were quick in deciding a topic for our assignment highlighting our great teamwork. 

# Week 6 

What have i learnt this week 

This week we learnt more about probability and path dependence is something that occurs through choices and methodologies of past actions. Markov models are used to measure evolution over a period of time. It shows how likely it is for something to move from one state to another. 

What do i now know that i did not before 

I didn't know that random walk models are useful to help business in creating scenarios that stimulate the stock market. They are especially used in areas such as finance. The probability of random walk models is 1/2 and they show the following quality in models: the stock market is unpredicatble in the short term, there is a clear differentiation between luck and skill. Many of the models have a mathematical element to them, for example the Markov Model involves the manipulation of equations through algebra. The riot model demonstrates an individuals threshold for rioting and can determine the hotspots for where riots would take place. I found this very interesting to learn that there are riot models created. 

What insights have i gained 

The insights i have gained this week is that there are specific models used for each situation/scenario however in saying this multiple models can be used for one problem, this highlights the versatility of models. Another interesting insight gained was that riots have models that predict where they would occur which i found interesting aswell. 

What are strengths and weaknesses i observed 

There were not any strengths i have observed this lesson. But one weakness is thing i should improve is to be more organised before lessons so i have an idea of what is being taught in the lesson beforehand, rather than learning it after the lesson. 

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them? 

One challenge our team encountered was that even though we had chosen a topic for our assignment in week 5, our team leader suddenly changed the topic without discussion without our team mates. I am aware this step was taken becuase our previous topic didn't answer the assignments' objectives well, but all our team whould have preffered if the team leader atleast made us aware of the topic being changed. This made it very diffcult for the rest of us as we had to start researching a new topic that we had no say in. However, we resolved this issue at a team meeting and handled the situation well and maturely.
