# Human-Complex-Reflective-Portfolio
# Week 1

What have I learnt this week 

This week was the first week of classes for this subject, within the 3 hours there was alot of content to learn and understand. Some of the key takeaways from this lesson was the general introduction to complex systems (eg. what they are, how they work, key characteristics). We also learnt about our classmates and teachers through a mural activity that we did, this allowed me to know my peers better. Complicated and complex systems are different, although they have some similarities they also have differences.

What do I now know that I did not before 

The whole idea of complex systems is something i know about now but not before. This lesson gave me an insight into what complex systems are  and how they govern and impact us as human beings. I also found out that complex systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated. 

What theory proved to be useful?

All of the theory discussed in the lesson proved to be useful, this is because we need to know the fundamentals of complex systems for our final assignment. Also, an understanding of complex systems will also be useful in everyday life.   

# Week 2

What have I learnt this week

The things i have learnt this week are that complex systems are indeed complex (hence the name). Complex systems provide models which can be helpful to experiment and test our ideas on how the world works. We also got more information about our assignment and formed groups. There are many reasons as to why we model and it highlights why modelling is important. These include 
	- Communication 
	- Prediction about the future 
	- Exploration of the world around us 
  
What insights have I gained 

That all models are wrong, but many are useful; us as humans just have to pick that right number of modest models that can help us better understand problems in complex systems around the world. Complex adaptive systems are the future of our lives and understanding this before we progress into our career will be highly beneficial. 
What are strengths and weaknesses i observed
It was really easy for me to communicate with my peers and form a group, however since it is just week 2 i couldn't add much on group work but as the semester progresses i will add updates about group work. Other than that there were no weaknesses that i observed this week. 

# Week 4 

What have I learnt this week 
There are different types of models that increase the level of integration, flexibility and realism within the world. These include system dynamic models, network models and agent based models. System dynamic models analyse different systems and provide feedback on the relationships between the systems and their surroundings. Agent based models are computational  models that stimulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with the goals of assessing their effects on the system as a whole. Whereas network models, is a database model that is designed as a flexible approach to represent objects and their relationships.

# Week 5

What have I learnt this week 

This week we learnt about probability within complex systems, such as aggregation , regularity and extremities. Probability distributions is a function which describes the likelihood of obtaining a possible value a random variable can take. Regularity describes the normal distributions in a bell shaped curve which usually are depicted with high accuracy. This shows that scores are evenly distributed throughout the scale with the majority distributed in the centre and outliers. 

What do i now know that I did not before 

Probability models make predictions to be made about random variables and their behaviour with surrounding systems. However these models are not fully accurate, but can be taken as a guide.

What are strengths and weaknesses I observed

We had a group meeting to discuss our assignment aswell as pick a topic for our assignment. We decided to pick our theme as smart cities and focus on various other broad topics. Some of the strengths i noticed was that our group worked together and split up our roles efficiently between our team members. We also were quick in deciding a topic for our assignment highlighting our great teamwork. 

# Week 6 

What have i learnt this week 

This week we learnt more about probability and path dependence is something that occurs through choices and methodologies of past actions
