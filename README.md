# Human-Complex-Reflective-Portfolio
# Week 1
**What have I learnt this week**

This week was the first week of classes for this subject, within the 3 hours there was alot of content to learn and understand. Some of the key takeaways from this lesson was the general introduction to complex systems (eg. what they are, how they work, key characteristics). We also learnt about our classmates and teachers through a mural activity that we did, this allowed me to know my peers better; this activity also helped me find suitable group memebers that share similar interests to me. I also learnt that complicated and complex systems are different, although they have some similarities they also have differences. Compex systems refer to a system with many components which interact with eachother, these systems are able to observe, learn and adapt to create change. Whereas complicated systems need an external force in order to introduce change in the system. Overall, there were many topics and themes discussed in this week that were very new to me, so it took a while for me to process the information into a way i was able to understand it.

**What do I now know that I did not before**

The whole idea of complex systems is something i know about now but not before and very new to me aswell. This lesson gave me an insight into what complex systems are and how they govern and impact us as human beings. This lesson also gave me insight into on how complex systems exist in our everyday lives in forms such as human economies, infastructures, and even in ourseleves (human brain and nervous system). This was a very interesting inisght that i gained in this lesson which inspired me to further research into other types of complex systems and their impact on us as humans. The human brain is a complex system; with the neurons acting as the components that interact with eachother to form circuits and share information aswell as observe and create change. I also found out that complex systems have boundaries such as open, closed and isolated. 

**What theory proved to be useful?**

All of the theory discussed in the lesson proved to be useful, this is because we need to know the fundamentals of complex systems in order to successfully complete our final assignment. Also, an understanding of complex systems will also be useful in everyday life as we grow older as adults and gain exposure to the outside world. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses I observed**

One of the weakness i observed is that i was unable to keep focused for the 2+ hours the lesson went for, although we had breaks in the middle it was still a bit diffuclt as it was our first lesson and i wasn't used to being in a class for more than 2 hours. Another weakness is that since alot of information was not on the slides but we had to listen to, it was difficult for me to take notes as we went on; however i hope i will improve with note-taking as the semester goes on. 

# Week 2

**What have I learnt this week**

The things i have learnt this week are that complex systems are indeed complex (hence the name). Complex systems provide models which can be helpful to experiment and test our ideas on how the world works. We also got more information about our assignment and formed groups. There are many reasons as to why we model and it highlights why modelling is important. These include 
	- Communication 
	- Prediction about the future 
	- Exploration of the world around us 
  
**What insights have I gained**

The insights gained this lessons is that all models are wrong, but many are useful; us as humans just have to pick that right number of modest models that can help us better understand problems in complex systems around the world. Complex adaptive systems are the future of our lives and understanding this before we progress into our career will be highly beneficial. Another insight gained is that one model has many uses and this can help improve on the wisdom of the crowd, hence models can be taken out of their initial purpose and shifted to another use and they would produce similar or better results highligting the versatility of models. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

The strengths i observed this week was that it was really easy for me to communicate with my peers and form a group, however since it is just week 2 i couldn't add much on group work but as the semester progresses i will add updates about group work. Other than that there were no weaknesses that i observed this week. 

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did i/my team handle them?**

The challenges i encountered this module was not fully understanding the content being taught, it took me a while to understand the concepts aswell as create a connection on how this content links with the whole course being taught. 

**What would I do better next time with what anticipated results?**

I would try do my own research before and after class so i understand the concepts and content. I should also ask more questions in class if i am unsure of something that is being taught. 

# Week 3: Didn't Attend Class 

# Week 4 

**What have I learnt this week**

There are different types of models that increase the level of integration, flexibility and realism within the world. These include system dynamic models, network models and agent based models. System dynamic models analyse different systems and provide feedback on the relationships between the systems and their surroundings. Agent based models are computational  models that stimulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with the goals of assessing their effects on the system as a whole. Whereas network models, is a database model that is designed as a flexible approach to represent objects and their relationships. 

**What do I now know that I did not before**

I have learnt that all these models can be applied to everyday life, making it easier for us as humans to make predictions. I also learnt about feedback loops and the inclusion of the diagrams helped me understand this foreign concept much better. 

**What insights have i gained?**

The insights gained this lesson was that not all the models mentioned above can be used for every situation. Agent based models are more suitable for real life situations whereas the other two ( system dynamic and network models) are less effective in stimulating solutions for real world problems. Therefore since my groups' issue is about education i have made note to use agent based models to complete the assignment. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses I observed?**

One of the weakness i had this week was not being able to catch up and understand the information as quickly as i would like to. It took me a while to grasp the concepts of all these models are how they are different fromm eachother aswell as which models are suitable for paticular situations. However, a strength i observed was that our group was able to communicate well and form a group chat quickly to talk about the assignment due. 

**What would i do better next time with what anticipated results?**

Things i would do better for next lesson is that i would pay more attention in class. Although class being nearly 3 hours long and hard to concentrate in i would like to take small breaks along the way so that i am attentative and listening. 


# Week 5

**What have I learnt this week**

This week we learnt about probability within complex systems, such as aggregation, regularity and extremities. Probability distributions is a function which describes the likelihood of obtaining a possible value a random variable can take. Regularity describes the normal distributions in a bell shaped curve which usually are depicted with high accuracy. This shows that scores are evenly distributed throughout the scale with the majority distributed in the centre and outliers. 

**What do i now know that I did not before**

Probability models make predictions to be made about random variables and their behaviour with surrounding systems. However these models are not fully accurate, but can be taken as a guide. In probability the chance of an event likely to occur will always add up to 1, with 0 being on the impossible side and 1 being certain. 

**What insights have I gained**

The insights i have gained this lesson was watching the TED talk given by Geoff West, this was something different compared to normal class routine so i found this very interesting. The inisghts gained from the video include how power laws help/contribute to the communications within cities which in turn allow them to thrive. Without these cities will indefinately collapse. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses I observed**

We had a group meeting to discuss our assignment aswell as pick a topic for our assignment. We decided to pick our theme as smart cities and focus on various other broad topics. Some of the strengths i noticed was that our group worked together and split up our roles efficiently between our team members. We also were quick in deciding a topic for our assignment highlighting our great teamwork. 

# Week 6 

**What have i learnt this week**

This week we learnt more about probability and path dependence is something that occurs through choices and methodologies of past actions. Markov models are used to measure evolution over a period of time. It shows how likely it is for something to move from one state to another. 

**What do i now know that i did not before**

I didn't know that random walk models are useful to help business in creating scenarios that stimulate the stock market. They are especially used in areas such as finance. The probability of random walk models is 1/2 and they show the following quality in models: the stock market is unpredicatble in the short term, there is a clear differentiation between luck and skill. Many of the models have a mathematical element to them, for example the Markov Model involves the manipulation of equations through algebra. The riot model demonstrates an individuals threshold for rioting and can determine the hotspots for where riots would take place. I found this very interesting to learn that there are riot models created. 

**What insights have i gained**

The insights i have gained this week is that there are specific models used for each situation/scenario however in saying this multiple models can be used for one problem, this highlights the versatility of models. Another interesting insight gained was that riots have models that predict where they would occur which i found interesting aswell. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

There were not any strengths i have observed this lesson. But one weakness is thing i should improve is to be more organised before lessons so i have an idea of what is being taught in the lesson beforehand, rather than learning it after the lesson. 

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I/my team handle them?**

One challenge our team encountered was that even though we had chosen a topic for our assignment in week 5, our team leader suddenly changed the topic without discussion without our team mates. I am aware this step was taken becuase our previous topic didn't answer the assignments' objectives well, but all our team whould have preffered if the team leader atleast made us aware of the topic being changed. This made it very diffcult for the rest of us as we had to start researching a new topic that we had no say in. However, we resolved this issue at a team meeting and handled the situation well and maturely. 

# Week 7 
**What have i learnt this week**

This week's lesson we learnt about a few different models which include the Schelling, Granovetter and Standing Ovation models. Schelling's segregation model is predicted through complex interactions in networks. Granovetter's Model showcase how the tail of distributions (the extremes) drive phenomena's to happen. The Standing Ovation models are a peer/group effect, they are a domain to think about when considering how people follow certain rules. Coordination and culture go hand in hand, i learnt how culture can be modelled through a series of coordination games. 

**What do i now know that i did not before**

Something i know now that i don't know before is the concept of how culture can also be modelled through coordination. With the Standing Ovation Model, i learnt that people standing at the front are not influenced by others but have a great influence on everyone behind them. This highlights that the people in front don't conform to societial expectations as oppossed to the people at the back (who cannot be seen) but still conform to society. This highlighted to me how society works and how indivduals have great impact on eachother. 

**What theory proved to be useful**

Most of the theory if not all proved to be useful this lesson. This lesson taught me alot of human psychology and how individuals have so much impact on one another and how models can depict this phenomena. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

There were no paticular strengths i observed this week, but one weakness is that i struggled to take notes during the lesson, therefore for next lesson i aim to take better notes that allow me to understand the concepts being taught in class. 

# Week 8: Mid-Sem Break 

# Week 9 
**What have i learnt this week**

The focus of this lesson was to go over our pre-submission task for the assignment. We were put into breakout rooms to discuss our assignment and what changes we have to make before the final submission. Although the tutor didn't get to us during this session, me and my team in our breakout room discussed what sections of the report we still have left and assigned roles for each section. 

**What do i now know that i did not before**

Since there wasn't anything being taught in this workshop lesson, there wasn't anything that i learnt per say. However, our group went through the report again and we made many edits on mistakes that we didn't find before. Therefore, i learnt how important it is to review your work and  peer-review assignments to produce the best quality work possible. 

**What insights have i gained**

The insights i have gained this workshop was on how to use jupyter notebook properly for our assignment. I also realised how important it is to communicate effectively within my group, the great teamwork between my team members allowed us to successfully submit our pre-submission without any difficulties. Although there were some complications because our topic was changed abruptly, my team still collaborated effectively and efficiently to finish the pre-submission before the deadline. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

There were no strengths that i observed this workshop, other than our group completeing the pre-submission and reviewing and correcting our assignment. A weakness i observed was that although our team was able to finish the assignment, we lacked communication between eachother (especially with the team leader). Although this is due to the nature of online learning, in the future i would like to plan meeting so that everyone can attend and are on the same page with the assignment. 

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how did i/my team handle them?**

One of the challenges my team encountered was with the peer-review reflections. Our team leader did a good job by taking the initiative and doing most of the peer review reflection, however the rest of the team members (including myself) would have preffered if she worked with us whist doing the reflection. She already wrote alot of feedback for the other group therefore it was hard for the rest of us to write more feedback because everything was already said or covered. 

**What would i do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

I think it is very important for us as a team to improve our commuication between eachother. This will allow for less misunderstanding and eevryone would know what their role is in the group.

# Week 10 
**What have i learnt this week**

This week was another review lesson for our assignment and this time our tutor gave us extensive feedback which was very valuable for our assignment. He pointed out that all of our section 3 was incorrect and didn't answer the question being asked. Section 3.1 specifically asked about our self study of supermarket models, however we didn't answer this component in our report and hence the other sections following were also answered incorrectly. 

**What do i now know that i did not before**

I wasn't aware that we didn't answer the question properly in section 3, although it was diffcult for us to delete all the hard work that we put into section 3 we knew that it was the right thing to do. However, after a group member's idea we decided to move all the text in section 3 as background information so that our work didn't go to waste. 

**What insights have i gained**

The insights i gained this workshop was that it is very important to communnicate well between our group so that when situations like this arise we can overcome it without any difficulties. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

The strengths i observed was my group being able to understand the question for section 3 and starting over again, we did more research and were slowly putting together ideas for section 3. 

# Week 11 
**What have i learnt this week**

Didn't learn anything paticular this week, we were just editing and reviewing our assignment with the feedback recieved from the peer-review as aswell as Juan. 

**What do i now know that i did not before** 

I didn't know how to use jupyter notebook and how to translate that onto github. Therefore, in this workshop i learnt abit on how to utilise these two programs for our assignment. 

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how did i/my team handle them?**

This week i struggled to use jupyter notebook and github. Our assignment needed to be changed from a readme file to a markdown, however it was very hard for us to do and we struggled to do this because whenever we added text the file we uploaded always coruppted. However, we handled the situation well as we waited for Juan to come and help us which in the end proved to be helpful as we were able to change the file to makrdown. 

**What would i do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

I would ask for assitance and help before so that i am aware of what to fix. It was pretty stressful not being able to change the files without knowing what's wrong. Therefore, next time i would take the initiative to ask for help or ask Juan to check our progress throughout so that we don't make mistakes closer to the deadline of the assignment. 

# Week 12 
**What have i learnt this week**

This week was the same as last week, we were still reviewing and editing our assignment. We also starting the other sections of the assignment and assigned roles for each section to be more organised than last time. 

**What do i now know that i did not before**

Since there was no theory taught this lesson and it was just us working on our group assignment, there was nothing new that i learnt this workshop other than how to use jupyter notebook. 

**What are strengths and weaknesses i observed**

There was no paticular strengths that i observed this week, however a weakness was communication within our group. We all struggled to pick a time suitable to have group meeting since eevryone was busy so it was hard to complete the work. However we resolved this issue by doing whatever work we can and communicating with eachother what we did.
